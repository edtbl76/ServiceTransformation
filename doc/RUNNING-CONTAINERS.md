### Stopping / Shutting Down
```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Launching from Intellij Services tool
1. Go to Tools --> Services (usually Alt-8 HotKey)
2. Under **_Docker_**, select each of the Services, Rght-Click and select **Run**
3. (or) you can right-click the **_Docker_** menu heading and select **Run** to start all of the containers.

## Launching from `docker-compose.yml` (Intellij)

In the margin of the docker-compose.yml file there is a
- double-green arrow next to the `services` directive. This will start **all** containers
- single-green arrows next to the individual containers that will start the those containers

## Launching from  the CLI in Detached Mode
```shell
docker run -d -p8080:8080 -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker" --name product-service-instance001 product-service
```
```text
c80a08eabc6a40b48dcb12f35503648f5a6178497927333cc47cfa5b43cb33a9
```
The output is the container hash

#### Validate Detached Process
```shell
docker ps | grep "service"
```
NOTE: since I specified a name, it isn't randomly generated by the Docker Engine.
```text
(base) ~/IdeaProjects/ServiceTransformation git:[main]
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
c80a08eabc6a   product-service   "java org.springfram…"   28 seconds ago   Up 27 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   product-service-instance001
```

#### Stopping Detached Process
```shell
docker rm -f product-service-instance-001
docker ps | grep "service"
```
The name of the service is returned from the first command. Since we don't see the table output from `docker ps` we know that the container is no longer running.
```text
product-service-instance001
```

## Launching from the CLI

```shell

To stop the container, just hit CTRL-C.
