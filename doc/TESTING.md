## Executing Test Runner

By default, `testRunner.sh` is set to test using containers.

You can execute tests against local instances of the services by prepending the execution statement prepended by the 
local port
(`PORT=7000 ./testRunner.sh`)
However, you will also need to start all the support containers (mongo, rabbit, mysql etc.) 

```shell
./testRunner.sh start stop
```
Output varies from verison to version, but the last line should look something like this...
```text
End, all tests OK:  Fri Jan 10 09:40:13 AM EST 2025
```
